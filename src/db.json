      "description": " JoyStick is a self-contained, network connected tangible sleep quality measuring device for the home setting. Most existing sleep quality measuring devices are aimed at the lab setting and especially targeted to be operated by adults. JoyStick makes it easier for adults and children to engage in a short psychomotor vigilance test right after they have woken up. Due to the success of the designed device JoyStick became a CHI submission. ",

      "description": "Audio Tales is a smart home system created to motivate children to perform daily tasks through immersive and interactive storytelling. It contains speakers and tags which can be placed in different locations inside the home. Thus it provides  personalized storytelling according to the daily tasks’ children need to perform (e.g brush their teeth, make their bed etc). Within this project it was my first time working with smart adaptive systems, visualizing datasets, using fetch API to add and  manipulate the behaviour and interaction of our prototypes. ",

      "description": "Inspired by the authors Strengers & Nickolls [1] we set out to explore the question of what would happen if smart products in the home weren’t honest. We conducted a critical inquiry study where we designed a ‘smart cup’ with randomised behaviour and tested it within participants’ homes and working areas. Our findings showcase that people’s behaviours are shaped and influenced by the narratives that smart devices push (as also noted by Strengers & Nickolls [1]). At the same time people also have very specific expectations on the devices themselves, to be and act in a ‘smart’ way.",

Every week a different person from the group can be the host of the ritual and facilitate the initial pouring of the wine into the carafe. Guests also have the role to honour the person who is sitting on their left by pouring wine to their glass. ",
